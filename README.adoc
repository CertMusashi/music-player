A modern offline music player with familiar designs for Android 11+.

This project aims to be a replacement with personal tweaks for the now-defunct https://github.com/kabouzeid/Phonograph[Phonograph] music player, but has no connections with it.

---

== Changes from Original Phocid

This fork is based on https://github.com/TJYSunset/Phocid[Phocid] and includes the following enhancements:

=== New Features

* **Tag Editing**: Edit music file metadata directly in the app (title, artist, album, album artist, genre, year, track number, disc number, comment, and lyrics) with support for MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, MP4, WMA, WAV, AIF, AIFF, and DSF formats
* **File Deletion**: Delete music files directly from the app with proper Android 11+ permission handling

=== Performance Improvements

* **Optimized Battery Usage**: Replaced busy-wait polling loops with proper coroutine signaling to reduce CPU wake-ups
* **Reduced RAM Consumption**: Removed unnecessary large heap allocation and implemented lazy loading for better memory efficiency
* **Improved Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations and optimized scan intervals for smoother user experience

=== UI/UX Enhancements

* **App Rebranded**: Application name changed from "Phocid" to "Music"

---

== Features

* Familiar user experience
* Better metadata support; Namely, multiple artists.
* Better sorting when your music library differs from your system language
* Regex-based blocklist

== Contributing

Please ask first if you want to work on big code changes.
Instead of directly contributing code to Phocid, it would be great if you can help with big upstream issues first, like https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/81. (Please let me know if you have successfully closed those!)
